# Real Estate Price Analysis – Poland

## Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analytical study of the Polish residential real estate market.  
The objective was to identify the key drivers influencing apartment prices and quantify their impact using statistical analysis and a predictive model.

The analysis includes:
- data cleaning and preprocessing,
- exploratory data analysis (EDA),
- correlation assessment,
- feature impact evaluation,
- linear regression model for price prediction.

The results provide insights into how property characteristics and amenities influence market valuation.

## Business Problem

Real estate pricing depends on multiple structural and locational factors.  
Understanding which features significantly influence price is critical for:

- property valuation,
- investment decision-making,
- pricing strategy optimization,
- market segmentation analysis.

The goal of this project is to determine which apartment attributes generate the strongest price premium.
